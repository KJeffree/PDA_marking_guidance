# PDA Marking Guide

## General Guidelines

- Everything the students submit must be their own work. They cannot use code that we have provided them in startpoints or lessons, etc. 

- The students need to provide a description for every assignment to demonstrate their understanding and provide context for images/diagrams.

- The code can be in any language.

- Uploads should not include draw.io files and any code should only be screenshots
